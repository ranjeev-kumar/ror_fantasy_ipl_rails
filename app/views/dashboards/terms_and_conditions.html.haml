            %ul.pdTop10
              %li.pdBtm10 In the Private League format of the Contest(s), Dream11 enables Users to create a league ("Private League") and invite other users, whether existing Users or otherwise, ("Invited User") to create Teams and participate in the Contest(s). Users may create a Private League to consist of a pre-specified number of Participants, that is, consisting of either 2 Participants, 3 Participants, 5 Participants or 10 Participants. The User creating the Private League shall submit the participation fee for such Private League and thereby join that Private League, shall supply a name for the Private League and be provided with a unique identification code ("League Code") (which will be issued to the account of such User). The User agrees and understands that once the Private League is created no change shall be permitted in the terms or constitution of the Private League, except for a change in the name of the League. The User creating the Private League shall provide Dream11 with the email address or Facebook account username of Invited Users to enable Dream11 to send a message or mail inviting such Invited User to register with Dream11 (if necessary) and participate in the Private League in relation to which the invite has been issued.
              %li.pdBtm10 In order to participate in the Private League, an Invited User shall input the League Code associated with the Private League and submit the participation fee for the Private League. Once the number of Participants in a Private League equals the number of pre-specified Participants for that Private League, the Private League shall be rendered operative and no other Invited Users or Users shall be permitted to participate in the Private League. In the event that any Private League does not contain the pre-specified number of Participants for that Private League within 1 hour prior to the commencement of the round/Contest, the Participants of such Private League will be provided with the option to convert the Private League into a Public league format, and permit the participation of Users without the League Code. It is clarified that Dream11 undertakes such conversion in a serialised manner and cannot and does not warrant that any Private League will be converted into a Public league format prior to the commencement of the round/Contest(s) or that any Users will join such Contest (s to make it operational. In case the number of Participants in any Private League (or converted Contest(s)) is less than the pre-specified number at the time of commencement of the round, such Contest(s) will not be operational and the participation fee paid by each User shall be returned to the account of such User without any charge or deduction.
              %li.pdBtm10 It is clarified that the participation of Invited Users in any Private League is subject to the pre-specified number of Participants for that Private League, and Dream11 shall not be liable to any person for the inability of any Invited User to participate in any Private League due to any cause whatsoever, including without limitation due to a hardware or technical malfunction or lack of eligibility of such Invited User to participate in the Contest(s).

              %li.pdBtm10 Dream11 provides users with three categories of accounts for the processing and reconciliation of payments in relation to the Amusement Facilities: (i) 'Unutilized' Account, (ii) Winnings Account, and (iii) Cash Bonus Account.
              %li.pdBtm10 The User's winnings in any Contest will reflect as credits to the User's Winnings Account. It is clarified that in no instance will Dream11 permit the transfer of any amounts in the User's accounts to any other category of account held by the user with Dream11 or any third party account, including a bank account held by a third party.
              %li.pdBtm10 Users shall be required to remit the required amount to Dream11 through the designated payment gateway. The payment made shall be credited to the User's accounts and each time a User enters a round, the applicable amount towards participation in the round shall be debited from the User's account. In debiting amounts from the User's accounts towards the participation fee of such user in any round or Contest(s), Dream11 shall first debit the User's 'Unutilized' Account, thereafter, any remaining amount of participation fee shall be debited from the User's Cash Bonus Account and thereafter, any remaining amount of participation fee shall be debited from the User's Winning Account. In case there is any amount remaining to be paid by the User in relation to such User's participation in any round(s) or Contest(s), the User will be taken to the designated payment gateway to give effect to such payment. In case any amount added by the User through such payment gateway exceeds the remaining amount of participation fee, the amount in excess shall be transferred to the User's 'Unutilized' Account and will be available for use in participation in any round(s) or Contest(s) or for withdrawal in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Debits from the 'Unutilized' Account for the purpose of enabling a user's participation in a Contest shall be made in order of the date of credit of amounts in the 'Unutilized' Account, and accordingly amounts credited into 'Unutilized' Account earlier in time shall be debited first.
              %li.pdBtm10 A User shall not be permitted to withdraw any amounts credited into such User's 'Unutilized' Account for any reason whatsoever. All amounts credited into a User's 'Unutilized' Account must be utilised within 335 days of credit. In case any unutilised amount lies in the 'Unutilized' Account after the completion of 335 days from the date of credit of such amount, Dream11 reserves the right to forfeit such unutilised amount, without liability or obligation to pay any compensation to the User.
              %li.pdBtm10 Withdrawal of any amount standing to the User's credit in the Winnings Account may be made by way of a request to Dream11 but shall occur automatically upon completion of 335 days from the date of credit of such amount in the User's Winnings Account. In either case, Dream11 shall effect an online transfer to the User's bank account on record with Dream11 within a commercially reasonable period of time. Such transfer will reflect as a debit to the User's Winnings Account. Dream11 shall not charge any processing fee for the online transfer of such amount from the Winnings Account to the User's bank account on record with Dream11. Users are requested to note that they will be required to provide valid photo identification and address proof documents for proof of identity and address in order for Dream11 to process the withdrawal request. The name mentioned on the User's photo identification document should correspond with the name provided by the User at the time of registration on Dream11, as well as the name and address existing in the records of the User's bank account as provided to Dream11. In the event that no bank account has been registered by the User against such User's account with Dream11, or the User has not verified his/her User account with Dream11, to Dream11's satisfaction and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, Dream11 shall provide such User with a notification to the User's email address as on record with Dream11 at least 30 days prior to the Auto Transfer Date, and in case the User fails to register a bank account with his/her User Account and/or to verify his/her User Account by the Auto Transfer Date, Dream11 shall be entitled to forfeit any amounts subject to transfer on the Auto Transfer Date. Failure to provide Dream11 with a valid bank account or valid identification documents (to Dream11's satisfaction) may result in the forfeiture of any amounts subject to transfer in accordance with this clause.
              %li.pdBtm10 The Cash Bonus Account shall contain amounts gratuitously issued by Dream11 to the User for use in participation in any Contest(s) and no User shall be permitted to transfer or request the transfer of any amount in to the Cash Bonus Account. The usage of any amounts issued and present in the Cash Bonus Account shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions, including without limitation, restrictions as to time within which such amount must be used, as applied by Dream11 and notified to the User at the time of issue of such amount. The issue of any amount to the Cash Bonus Account is subject to the sole discretion of Dream11 and cannot be demanded by any User as a matter of right. The issue of any such amount by Deam11 on any day shall not entitle the user to demand the issuance of such amount at any subsequent period in time nor create an expectation of recurring issue of such amount by Dream11 to such User. The amount standing to the credit of the User in the Cash Bonus Account may be used by such User for the sole purpose of setting off against the participation fee in any Contest, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The amount standing to the credit of the User in such User's Cash Bonus Account shall not be withdraw-able or transferrable to any other account of the User, including the bank account of such User, or of any other User or person, other that as part of the winnings of a User in any Contest(s). In case the User terminates his/her account with Dream11 or such account if terminated by Dream11, all amounts standing to the credit of such User in the Cash Bonus Account shall return to Dream11 and the User shall not have any right or interest in such amounts.
              %li.pdBtm10 Users agree that once they confirm a transaction on Dream11, they shall be bound by and make payment for that transaction.
              %li.pdBtm10 The User acknowledges that transactions on Dream11 may take up to 24 hours to be processed. Any amount paid or transferred into the User's 'Unutilized' Account or Winnings Account may take up to 24 hours to reflect in the User's 'Unutilized' Account or Winnings Account balance. Similarly, money debited from the User's Cash Bonus Account, 'Unutilized' Account or Winnings Account may take up to 24 hours to reflect in the User's 'Unutilized' Account or Winnings Account balance. Users agree not to raise any complaint or claim against Dream11 in respect of any delay, including any lost opportunity to join any Contest or round due to delay in crediting of transaction amount into any of the User's accounts
              %li.pdBtm10
                A transaction, once confirmed, is final and no cancellation is permissible. However, Dream11 may, at its sole and absolute discretion, permit a User to cancel a transaction and refund the amount paid:
